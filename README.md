# OpenNEX-Team6

<H1> Purpose of the project <H2>
<p>The NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) represents a new platform for the Earth science community that provides a mechanism for scientific collaboration and knowledge sharing.  NEX combines state-of-the-art supercomputing, Earth system modeling, workflow management, NASA remote sensing data feeds, and a knowledge sharing platform to deliver a complete work environment in which users can explore and analyze large datasets, run modeling codes, collaborate on new or existing projects, and quickly share results among the Earth Science communities.
</p>
<p> In this project we try to explore to facets of Open NEX i.e. Social Networks and Project Management. The above prototype has been designed and developed as part of a semester long project for 'Software Architecture and Design' course taught by Prof. Jia Zhang at Carnegie Mellon Universtiy, Silicon Valley campus.
